steps for Heroku

- install heroku NOT to program files

- add funky stuff to package.json

- create the Procfile NOT with .txt extension

- add Ruby to path for foreman otherwise it will give you: 'foreman' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file.
I reinstalled it, still the same error. Ok, fixed the error, had to add C:\Program Files (x86)\Heroku\ruby-1.9.2\bin to Windows %PATH%
