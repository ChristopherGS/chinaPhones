steps for Heroku

- install heroku NOT to program files

- add funky stuff to package.json

- create the Procfile NOT with .txt extension

- add Ruby to path for foreman otherwise it will give you: 'foreman' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file.
I reinstalled it, still the same error. Ok, fixed the error, had to add C:\Program Files (x86)\Heroku\ruby-1.9.2\bin to Windows %PATH%

- Then when you attempt to start foreman you will get the ruby errors 'Bad file descriptor'

To resolve this, 
gem uninstall foreman   
gem install foreman -v 0.61.0

might take a while

then test it, then quit (CTRL-C)

- Then heroku create

- Then git push heroku master
