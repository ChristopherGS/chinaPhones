steps for Heroku

- install heroku NOT to program files

- add funky stuff to package.json

- create the Procfile NOT with .txt extension

- add Ruby to path for foreman otherwise it will give you: 'foreman' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file.
I reinstalled it, still the same error. Ok, fixed the error, had to add C:\Program Files (x86)\Heroku\ruby-1.9.2\bin to Windows %PATH%

- Then when you attempt to start foreman you will get the ruby errors 'Bad file descriptor'

To resolve this, 
gem uninstall foreman   
gem install foreman -v 0.61.0

might take a while

then test it, then quit (CTRL-C)

- Then heroku create

- Then git push heroku master

OPEN GIT BASH

1) You'll need to add ssh keys:  heroku keys:add

2) Then you can do git push heroku master

3) all will look OK BUT IT IS NOT

When you try to do heroku ps it will crash

Need to remove the .gitignore file
and then add the npm modules

As the stackoverflow answer above highlights, it's a good idea to specify npm in your package.json file (under engines)

NOW heroku ps will work

BUT you will get an error if you haven't setup your port correctly in server.js
